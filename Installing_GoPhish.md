## Setting up GoPhish
GoPhish is an automated phishing utility written in the Go language. In order to use it, youâ€™ll need to have an SMTP server to send the mail through and a web server at which victims will land. Although you can create both of these within GoPhish, doing so might increase your chances of detection. I suggest setting up these three firewall rules to prevent detection or collateral damage:

 - Allow port **3333/tcp** (the port for the GoPhish web admin interface) and port 22 (the SSH port) from your network only
 - Allow port **80/tcp** (the default port for your landing page, though you could use port **443/tcp** with an SSL/TLS certificate for more realism) from your network and the victim IP ranges only
 - Allow port **25/tcp** (the port for SMTP traffic) in the outbound direction only

### GoLang

efore installing GoPhish, you need to install GoLang. Instructions for doing so are located [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Ubuntu)).

### Installing GoPhish
From the [GoPhish documentation](https://docs.getgophish.com/user-guide/installation), installation is as simple as:

 - To install GoPhish, simply run:
	'go get github.com/gophish/gophish`

- This downloads GoPhish into your `$GOPATH`
 - Next, navigate to:
		`$GOPATH/src/github.com/gophish/gophish` 
 - and run the command:
		`go build`
 - This builds a GoPhish binary in the current directory.
